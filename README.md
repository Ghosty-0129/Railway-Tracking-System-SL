Train Tracking System Live


**Sri Lanka Railway Tracking App**
This project is a railway tracking application designed to provide users with a visual representation of train movements within Sri Lanka's railway network. The app is built using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

**Features**
Interactive User Interface: Provides an engaging and user-friendly experience for tracking train locations.
Dummy Data Integration: Demonstrates the concept using placeholder data, simulating real-time train movements.
Modular Codebase: Built with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of real-time GPS data in the future.
**Motivation**
The app was developed to showcase the potential of modern web technologies in solving real-world challenges like railway tracking, even in the absence of live GPS data.
